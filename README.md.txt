## 1 INTRODUCTION

There are 6 common figure skating jumps for competition: the Toe Loop, Salchow, Loop, Flip, Lutz, and Axel. Here is a diagram and terms we will be using.

## 2 THE TOE LOOP JUMP

Invented by Bruce Mapes in the 1920s, the Toe Loop is one of the simplest jumps out of the six jumps.

### 2.1 The Toe Loop

The Toe Loop starts with a forward approach on the inside edge of the skate’s blade. Then, the skater switches to a backward-facing orientation, kicking off with the backward outside edge and using a toe pick to add lift before landing on that same outside edge.

### 2.2 The Physics of a Single Toe Loop

The physics of a single Toe Loop is relatively simple. There is angular momentum acting on the skater as they launch and spin. There is vertical velocity as the skater moves from their jump to landing, and there is gravity acting on the skater as they land. The launch of a single jump isn’t as hard as a triple or quad jump, as the height isn’t much of a factor in the jump. But when the skater lands on a single blade of their skate and on ice, knowing what forces are acting on the skater determines if their landing is successful. For the Toe Loop, there is more angular momentum as the toe pick helps the skater create more spin to their jump.

### 2.3 The Physics of The Quad Toe Loop

Using a study done by *[NAME]* called "Characteristics of triple and quadruple toe-loops performed during the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics," this study will help in terms of numbers and mathematical equations to understand the forces at work for a triple and/or quad Toe Loop. The goal of this study was to help coaches understand and teach the process of landing a triple/quad toe loop.

#### 2.3.1 The Study of The Triple/Quad Toe Loop

The data for this study was collected from the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics from the men’s short and long programs plus their warm-up and practices. Four cameras were used to determine and record these jumps. During the 2002 Winter Olympics, 71 quadruple Toe Loop or quadruple Toe Loop combination jumps were attempted, but this study only focuses on the 33 quadruple Toe Loop attempts not in combination. Out of the 33 quadruple Toe Loop jumps attempted, only 13 were landed successfully. This study deems a successful landing or a clean landing as one where the skater lands on one foot and without using their hands or their outer foot for balance. In other words, a successful landing is when the skater doesn’t step out of the jump. The study uses Tyes as skaters who can do the quadruple Toe Loop and Tno as skaters who can’t do the quadruple Toe Loop.

> Four key events were identified for each jump: toe-pick (instant the toe-pick was placed into the ice); take-off (last contact with the ice); max height (top of the flight phase); and landing (instant of contact with the ice). Additionally, each jump was divided into three phases: approach; propulsion; and flight. The approach phase began at the initiation of the three turn entering the jump and ended at toe-pick. The propulsion phase began at toe-pick and ended at take-off. The flight phase began at the takeoff and ended at landing. In total, 21 kinematic variables describing the position and motion of the skater were calculated along with the times of the propulsive and flight phases. [1]

> Average approach speed (AppSpeed) was calculated as the average magnitude of the horizontal velocity during the approach. Knee flexion at toe-pick was calculated for the glide (GlideKneeTP) and take-off (TOKneeTP) legs and reported such that zero degrees correspond to a fully extended position. For all skaters except one, who jumped in the opposite direction, the glide leg was the right leg and the take-off leg was the left. Toe-pick distance (TPDist) was calculated as the horizontal distance between the heel of the glide foot and the toe of the take-off foot at the instant of toe-pick. Vertical (VelVT0) and horizontal (VelHT0) velocities at take-off were calculated for the centers of mass of the skaters. Take-off angle (AngleT0) was calculated as the inverse tangent of the VelVT0 divided by the VelHT0. Backward tilt (Tilt) was defined as the angle between the longitudinal axis of the skater’s trunk and a vertical axis that was projected onto a vertical plane parallel to the skater’s direction of travel during the flight phase. Average rotational velocity (RotVel) was calculated from the hip segment about the longitudinal axis during the flight phase. Maximum jump height was defined as the maximum vertical displacement of the center of mass (CM) of the skaters during flight. Hip and shoulder rotation angles (Figure 4), measured as the angle between the two hips and shoulders, respectively, and a line perpendicular to the direction of travel of the jump in the horizontal plane, were calculated at toe-pick (HipRotTP, ShRotTP), take-off (HipRotT0, ShRotT0), and landing (HipRotLAND, ShRotLAND). Heights of the CM at the take-off (HeightCMT0) and at the landing (HeightCMLAND) were calculated as the vertical position of the CM above the ice surface at these two instances. Lastly, to measure the openness or closedness of the skaters’ positions, in terms of arm and leg position, a variable, body position (BodyPos), was defined. Body position was determined by averaging the distances of the two wrists and free (glide) leg ankle from the longitudinal axis of the skater in the transverse plane of the skater at take-off, throughout the flight phase, and at landing (Figure 5). This measure was chosen in lieu of reporting the skaters’ moments of inertia to provide coaches with a practical measure that is easily visualized in comparison to the body positions that their own skaters assume during these jumps. The measure was adapted from an ankle to ankle position measure reported by Albert and Miller (1996) in a study of double Axels. A comparison of the BodyPos variable and the moment of inertia calculated about a skater’s longitudinal axis for a quadruple toe-loop is provided in Figure 6. Notice that the two variables follow a similar trend throughout the phases of the jump, but that the scale on BodyPos has a more immediate visual meaning to the non-scientist since it is reported in meters. Variables dependent on stature, TPDist, HeightC0M, and BodyPos were scaled using a ratio to the skaters’ heights to the average height of the skaters. [1]

#### 2.3.2 The Study Results of The Triple/Quad Toe Loop

> The average horizontal approach speeds were similar for all jumps (Table 2) with the Q jumps on average only 6 jumps. [1] Through the approach, as the skaters prepared for the toe-pick, there was gradual downward motion of their centers of mass due to flexion of the glide knee. The knees of the glide legs then started to extend on average 0.12 to 0.14 s prior to toe-pick. The toe-pick of the take-off foot was placed into the ice an average of 0.76m from the glide foot for the Q jumps and generally centered behind the right hip. Toe-pick distance tended to be slightly less for the Q jumps compared to the Tyes jumps. However, TPDist was somewhat variable from jump to jump for individual skaters and not all skaters who completed both quadruple and triple toe-loops consistently had shorter TPDist for their Q jumps. Both the timing and positioning of the hip and shoulder rotation in this study were also observed to be markedly different between the Tyes and Tno groups. [1]

## 3 THE FLIP JUMP

### 3.1 The Physics of The Quad Flip

A study done with the assistance of Waseda University Figure Skating Club worked with a nationally ranked male skater who performed single, double, and triple flip jumps. Data was collected using five IMUs and six high-resolution cameras.

Data processing included filtering and transformation of signals to derive kinematic parameters at take-off and during flight.

#### 3.1.1 The Results

Results showed significant differences in kinematic parameters among single, double, and triple flips, particularly in vertical velocity and angular parameters.

## 4 THE AXEL JUMP

The Axel Paulsen jump is considered the most technically difficult figure skating jump. It is divided into three phases: entrance, flight, and landing.

### 4.1 The Physics of The Quad Axel

Research involved a Polish elite male junior skater who performed various jumps, providing valuable kinematic data for analysis.
